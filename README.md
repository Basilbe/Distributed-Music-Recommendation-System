# Distributed-Music-Recommendation-System
In recent years, music streaming services have gained immense popularity, leading to an everincreasing demand for personalized music recommendations. This project focuses on developing 
a Distributed Music Recommendation System using Python and the Spotify API. The system 
employs both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to suggest tracks to 
users based on their preferences. Furthermore, the project explores the performance benefits of 
implementing a distributed architecture using the Message Passing Interface (MPI), comparing it 
with a traditional sequential implementation.

# Scope
The scope of this project includes:

• Collecting music data from Spotify using their API.

• Preprocessing the collected data for analysis.

• Implementing collaborative and content-based filtering algorithms to generate music 
recommendations.

• Developing both sequential and distributed implementations of the recommendation 
system.

• Evaluating the performance of both implementations through execution time 
measurements.

The project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of distributed computing in enhancing the 
performance of data processing tasks, particularly in the context of music recommendation.
